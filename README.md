# Installation

* react-native init helloworld

# Running App

* react-native run-ios
  * This takes a while the first time
  * Opens simulator
  * Starts Metro-bundler
  * Puts app on the simulator screen
    * cmd-r to reload
    * cmd-d / shake for dev tools
  * Unlike EXPO, does not re-bundle every time you save a module, need to press cmd-r in simulator.
  * Like expo, rebundling is fast
